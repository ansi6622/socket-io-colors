# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for 
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide 
of the Socket.IO website.

## Getting Started

The guide above is a great tutorial to follow along with.  If you would like to incrementally build this up yourself, the repo uses [git tags](http://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) for each step of the application. You can check these out to see intermediate snapshots of the code.

To start: `git checkout init`

To see tags: `git tag`

Final complete app: `git checkout 5-server-broadcast`
